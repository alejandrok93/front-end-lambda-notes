## Code Challenges

This repository contains code challenges to test algorithm, data structures, and general problem solving abilities. The goal of these challenges is to improve my ability to solve algorithmic problems and prepare for coding interviews. The code challenges are done in Python and Javascript.

The code challenges are done every day and sourced from the following resources:

- Lambda School Daily Code Challenge
- HackerRank
- Interview Cake
- LeetCode
- Pramp
